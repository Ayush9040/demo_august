              Hunger still remains a fact of life for many people in our country
              and around the world despite unprecedented economic growth. Even
              in Mumbai, the maximum city and the financial capital of the
              country there are many who cannot afford two-square meals a day or
              the food they eat hardly has any nutritious value. We de- cided to
              change this. To work against the scourge of Hunger, The Yoga
              Institute launched the Annam Brahma initiative in 2018.
