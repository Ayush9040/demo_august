            'Prana is the vital energy or life force, which exists in all of us. The fight against respiratory problems begins with a strong will to overcome one’s disability and has to be backed by an implicit faith in oneself. With a strong emphasis on ancient yogic knowledge and techniques, The Yoga Institute has been conducting powerful Respiratory Camps since 1987. In these camps, participants are taught yoga breathing techniques and pranayama techniques for improving lung capacity and function, mind-body balance, increased calmness and healing. Respiratory health has been well-documented in traditional systems of well-being over several millennia. The Yogic life strengthens your will, augments your faith in yourself and opens air passages. How soon you can breathe with ease and on your own, depends on yourself. What are you waiting for? Begin now!'

            'Obesity is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world and particularly in India. There are several contributing factors towards this problem. Despite following different types of diet and weight loss programs, the results are often not satisfactory. The basic reason for this ‘yo-yo effect’ is that obesity is not the cause of the problem. It’s only the effect of some deep-rooted problem within one’s total personality complex. Yoga deals with obesity at all levels - physical, mental and spiritual and with a focus on diet. Keeping these factors in mind, The Yoga Institute has designed a special 1-day yoga camp on Weight Management. This camp will provide you with a holistic approach on wellness and train you in effective Yoga poses for weight loss. ',
