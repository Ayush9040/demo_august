Coming from France, I really wanted to enrol in an “on-campus” class to receive good knowledge. I chose the 2 Months part-time TTC to allow me to get enough time to settle in the course. During this period, I also stayed at the hostel. It was a total immersion in yogic life. I met wonderful teachers, formed sincere links with beautiful people, ate fresh and delicious food, walked in the magnificent garden and had the opportunity to meet Dr. Hansaji Yogendra many times. My life changed in a positive way! I have learned to respect and love myself, to keep faith and hope in every situation. I allow myself to live my own life, to be me just as I am.

I`m Mexican and here, when we think of yoga, 98% of people will just picture postures that will make you look like a beautiful `pretzel` or someone in a meditative posture “being Zen”. After much research, I found this Institute, which definitely changed my life for good and I am always going to be grateful for it. Because here, I could not only study yoga, to understand this amazing way of life, the root and essence of it. What is so valuable is that for every technique, asanas, kriya, pranayama, meditation, etc., teachers explained limitations and contraindications also. What I experience in my country or even online are so many studios that just teach you the postures and refer to it as a workout and not even talk about the limitations or what yoga means. For me, every session was a mind-blowing moment of knowledge. Every teacher is so amazing, happy and smiling. They teach such difficult knowledge like Yoga Sutras in a very simple way, and the way they prepare you in Practice Teaching classes to become a teacher is amazing; for me, each one of them is my guru. I am definitely coming back to do the advanced course.',

In European countries we have a misconception of the Yoga term and we are also not very open to understand Yoga in a broader way. Over there, it is difficult to find real Gurus and proper knowledgeable people. Here, the 3 MTTC is being a very intensive experience, full of theory and practice but also fun. This course requires all your senses, energy, concentration, and open-mindedness but once you bring all these with you, half of the learning process is acquired. During this time, I also participated as a volunteer in a kids’ workshop, which gave me an idea about how Yoga could be presented to different groups. Once my 3 MTTC is finished, I’ve decided to take all the experiences that The Yoga Institute is awakening in me. Hopefully, this can make a change in the misconception of what Yoga is in some European countries.',
