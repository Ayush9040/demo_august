We must learn to accept what comes our way and move on. Asanas and pranayamas , when done daily definitely aide physical and mental development. Other than that, maintaining a daily routine where one gets up early in the morning and sleeps on time, eats on time, etc. really helps one perform better. ',

I really appreciate the depth of teaching and the quality of the teachers at the institute. The facilities provided at the institute are excellent and our experience worth remembering.

    info:'Why Yoga? I have to say that before coming here I thought that yoga was just doing Asanas, and for example, my parents thought that it was just a hippie activity. In European countries we have a misconception of the Yoga term and we are also not very open to understand Yoga in a broader way. Over there, it is difficult to find real Gurus and proper knowledgeable people. Here, the 3 MTTC is being a very intensive experience, full of theory and practice but also fun. This course requires all your senses, energy, concentration, and open-mindedness but once you bring all these with you, half of the learning process is acquired. During this time, I also participated as a volunteer in a kids’ workshop, which gave me an idea about how Yoga could be presented to different groups. Once my 3 MTTC is finished, I’ve decided to take all the experiences that The Yoga Institute is awakening in me. Hopefully, this can make a change in the misconception of what Yoga is in some European countries.',
