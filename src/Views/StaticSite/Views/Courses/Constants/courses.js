Despite following different type of diet and weight loss programs, the results are often not satisfactory. The basic reason for this ‘yoyo effect’ is that obesity is not the cause of the problem. It’s only the effect of some deep-rooted problem within one’s total personality complex. Yoga deals with obesity at all levels- physical, mental, spiritual along with diet.
