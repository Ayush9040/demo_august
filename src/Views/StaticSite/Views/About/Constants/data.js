          Dr. Jayadeva Yogendra, fondly known as Dr. Sahab, was a true yogi who showed the world how to live a balanced and a perfect yogic life. He served as the President of The Yoga Institute and continued his father’s legacy with aplomb until he took his samadhi in 2018.  Dr. Jayadeva’s teachings, filled with deep wisdom, shows the right path, and provides answers to all the problems of people even to this day. 
          `,

      `
          Dr. Jayadeva completed his Masters in Samkhya and Yoga in 1952 from Mumbai University. He was awarded the Hargobindas scholarship for a Ph.D. (Dr. of Philosophy), in 1955, for his thesis on 'Moksha Parvan'. He was a guru, a guide, and an ideal to millions who came to him. His uniqueness lied in his simplicity and ability to provide simple solutions to complex problems. Dr. Jayadeva was a true yogi in the middle of a bustling world. He never desired publicity for himself and yet experts from a wide array of fields thronged to him for guidance and understanding. 
  
          `,

      `
          Dr. Sahab is the architect behind the signature offerings of the institute – the teacher training courses, camps, and other wellness programs. He specially designed these for the common man and his common problems. He integrated attitude-based concepts into yoga training and life activities which was the greatest contribution to the school of yoga. He also served as the Editor of the Institute’s monthly Journal, “Yoga & Total Health.”
  
          `,

      `
            Furthermore, Dr. Jayadeva founded the International Board of Yoga in 1975 to counter the wrong teachings in the name of Yoga. He decoded the classical systems of yoga and presented them in a way which would make them actionable. He made yoga easy to follow for the 21st century man. He carried forward the main principle of the institute – application of knowledge. Dr. Sahab was a man of simple words and a perfect example of how to lead a life in modern times. It cannot be said of many that they practice what they preach but Dr. Jayadeva was the true embodiment of this saying. He never taught anything other than what he practiced himself. Students at the Institute continue to draw inspiration from his wisdom, compassion, wit, and unflinching commitment to truth.

      `Born in Bengal in 1798, Paramahamsa Madhavdas Ji was a true Yoga Master hailing from the Mukhopadhyaya family. During his long life of 123 years, he was notably responsible for the revival of yogic practices which had vanished from India at the time. His childhood and upbringing inspired in him a devotional faith towards yoga. He left home at the tender age of 23 to study various Hatha yoga techniques and the health advantages of Yoga practices in order to promote spiritual health and growth of consciousness. At the age of 80, after 50 years of exploring India on foot and practicing yoga in the seclusion of the Himalayas (he spent a full 12 years there in solitude), he decided to start teaching on the banks of the river Narmada in Gujarat.
    Shri Yogendra Ji's guide and spiritual master, Shri Madhavdas Ji, was introduced to him by the Universe in a marvelous way.`,
      `Paramhamsa Madhavdas Ji was giving a talk in Madhavbaug, Mumbai, in 1916, when he met Shri Yogendra Ji. Shri Yogendra Ji was awestruck by his teacher's wisdom and eminence. Madhavdas Ji, too, noticed a special spark in Shri Yogendra Ji. The first thing he told Yogendra Ji was, “I have waited for you for all these years.” Madhavdas Ji was 118 at the time. During his lifetime, Paramahamsa Madhavdas Ji selected just 2 pupils for learning Hatha Yoga. He had a keen sense of the future of yoga and, after a long search, picked Shri Yogendra Ji to carry the "Yoga torch" around the world.
    Paramahamsa Madhavdas Ji was a master of many different Yoga traditions. He was well-versed in holy practices, but the spiritual upliftment of the masses was his most important goal. He arranged an All-India Sadhu convention in 1909 to reform the hermit order. His outstanding contribution to Yoga continues to this day. The Yoga Institute, now nearly 100 years old, continues to preach the message of humanity, peace, and goodwill by following the values established by the Founder and his holiness Paramahamsa Madhavdas Ji.

He believed that if something is worth doing, it is worth doing well. He could foresee the future. He was a yogi who demonstrated that being a householder can also enable you to achieve mastery over your physical and mental senses.
