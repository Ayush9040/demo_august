With a strong emphasis on ancient yogic knowledge and techniques, The Yoga Institute has been conducting powerful Respiratory CAMPS since 1987. Respiratory health has been well documented in traditional systems of wellbeing over several millennia. The Yogic life strengthens your will, augments your faith in yourself and opens air passages.

Despite following different types of diet and weight loss programs, the results are often not satisfactory. The basic reason for this ‘yoyo effect’ is that obesity is not the cause of the problem. It’s only the effect of some deep-rooted problem within one’s total personality complex. Yoga deals with obesity at all levels- physical, mental, spiritual along with diet. Keeping all these in mind, The Yoga Institute has designed a special 1-day camp on Weight Management.',
