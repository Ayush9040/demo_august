      'I can say that the 2 Months Online Teacher Training Course is just mind blowing! I`m Mexican and here, when we think of yoga, 98% of people will just picture postures that will make you look like a beautiful “pretzel” or someone in a meditative posture “Being Zen”. After much research, I finally found this Institute, which definitely changed my life for good and I am always going to be grateful for it. Because here, I could finally study yoga, to understand this amazing way of life, the root and essence of it. What is so valuable is that for every technique, asanas, kriya, pranayama, meditation, etc., teachers explained limitations and contraindications first. What I experience in my country or even online are so many studios that just teach you the postures and refer to it as a workout and not even talk about the limitations or what yoga means. For me, every session was a mind-blowing moment of knowledge. Every teacher is so amazing, happy and smiling. They teach such difficult knowledge like Yoga Sutras in a very simple way, and the way they prepare you in Practice Teaching classes to become a teacher is amazing; for me, each one of them is my guru. I am definitely coming back to do the advanced course.',

      'I was interested in Yoga since a long time. I was practicing it in Spain, China & other places however it was in The Yoga Institute that I learnt what real Yoga is. I discovered that Yoga is not just a set of gymnastic stretches but comprises philosophy & study of mind. I started coming just for some weekend classes, then gave a try to 21 Days Better Living Course, which I loved and I really recommend it. Later i did my Teachers Training Course and now I’m a Yoga instructor. Also the Institute is QCI certified. The Sattvic food offered at The Yoga Institute is delicious. I think Yoga can have impact on our lives and The Yoga Institute is one of the best places in the world to discover it.',

      'My journey with The Yoga Institute started at the beginning of this year where I found myself part of the TTC, training as a yoga teacher. The Institute has shown me that yoga is more than asanas and how to incorporate the yogic lifestyle in our daily lives. On this journey, it has united me with a community of like-minded people, who are filled with love and kindness for one and another, and I’m so happy to be part of it. Recently I got a chance to attend the 7-Day Health Camp and it felt like pure joy and peace. I am so grateful to the teachers for sharing their knowledge and for guiding us through this path. For me, The Yoga Institute is and will always be a home of bliss.',

      'Completing my yoga teacher’s training at The Yoga Institute has made such a positive impact on my life. Alongside understanding the physical aspects of yoga, we learned subtle principles on how to live our lives. My current routines have also been changed by the newly implemented self-study practices I was introduced to in the course. I am so grateful for the journey I’ve had with TYI and I’m very excited to continue further with my own practice.',
