    description : 'India is home to 25% of the world’s hungry population. Established in 2018, Annam Brahma (Food is God), a charitable initiative from The Yoga Institute is a tribute to Dr. Jayadeva Yogendra who envisioned enriching the lives of the poor with healthy and clean Sattvik food. We aim to eradicate malnutrition, and poverty-driven hunger and change the dynamics of society. The food is prepared with less oil, spices, and fats and rather it is filled with nutrition by including ghee, dry fruits, and fresh vegetables in the preparation of the food.Every day, fresh, nutritious, healthy Sattvik food is served twice a day for 365 days to needy and poor people. Till date, more than 40 lakh meals have been distributed. Presently, this drive has been extended to ‘Annam Brahma on Wheels’ distributing food to many hospitals like VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz and Bhabha Hospital in Bandra etc. and various slums of Mumbai. Our goal for the coming year is to provide 30,000 meals in and around BMC hospitals and slum areas.',
